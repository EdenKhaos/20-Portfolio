Now that you've worked with React and have multiple projects to share, you'll be updating your portfolio and other materials to build toward being employer competitive. Creating a portfolio using React will help set you apart from other developers whose portfolios do not use some of the latest technologies.

## Requirements

3. Modified personal image and resume section and portfolio projects
4. Updated about and skill section
